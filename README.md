# Updated Official Localization
This resource pack adds a modified Belarusian localization to the game, changing some names that cannot be 
changed according to Mojang Studios rules. We have reworked the names of some mobs *(this can be switched)*,
items and biomes.

## What has been changed?
- Changed names that Mojang Studios [prohibited](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xxDvR2MrPUaxXwNfn-oJX-fBerEsZkfo/edit?gid=810030519#gid=810030519) from localizing.
- Fixed visual translation errors where text went beyond the design.
- *And even more updates after the release!*

# New Mods Translates
We regularly quickly translate popular and not only mods for the game. We try to make them as close as possible
to the vanilla translation of the game, so that everything fits perfectly in your modpack!
At the moment we have translated such popular mods as [Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra), [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create), [BetterF3](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterf3), [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris), [Bioms O'Plenty](https://modrinth.com/mod/biomes-o-plenty), etc.
